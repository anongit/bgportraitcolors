# Custom Colors for Infinity Engine games

This mod allows you set custom portrait colors for hitpoints and the border of a selected character by binary patching the game executable file.

Before installing edit the [infinitycolors.ini](infinitycolors/infinitycolors.ini) file.<br>
You can use [a color picker](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=color+picker+%2300fa00) to choose colors.

Don't forget to convert them from **#RRGGBB** to **0xBBGGRR**.<br>
For example, let's say you picked **#bc6c04** (brown), you will need to change it to **0x046cbc**.
